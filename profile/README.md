# HYPAD #

Hypercomplex-based Automatic Differentiation (HYPAD) is a technique that uses Hypercomplex algebras like complex numbers ($i^2=-1$), dual numbers $(\epsilon^2=0)$ to compute derivatives in computational applications. 
In contrast to general automatic differentiation approaches, where a source code is interpreted to provide a new code that computes derivatives or a computational graph is interpreted to produce a code that computes derivatives, HYPAD
concentrates all techniquesuses arithmetic operations
